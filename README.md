### VpK - Visually presented Kubernetes

An application that presents Kubernetes resources and configurations in a visual and graphic fashion.
VpK can be installed and run on a local computer (requires Node.js and NPM) or run from a Docker container.  Refer to the documentation website link for information on installing the software.  

    The following screenshots are automatically created by VpK and not manually created.

### VpK key points

- VpK is designed to capture a point-in-time snapshot of the cluster.

- VpK provides the ability to view the captured snapshot in a disconnected fashion.  Once the snapshot is created the user no longer needs to be connected to the cluster.

- VpK will __not__ modify a Kubernetes cluster.  It is designed as read-only.

- VpK is __not__ a real-time monitoring tool.

### Application features

- VpK accesses a Kubernetes cluster via an established kubectl CLI and saves query results, called a __snapshot__, in a local directory. 

- The locally stored __snapshot__ can be reused. This snapshot enables disconnected use of VpK to review the K8s resource data.  Once a snapshot is created VpK does not require connecting to the K8s cluster to view the collected data.
 
- A interactive 3D view of the K8s cluster.  This view supports zoom, rotate, tilt, and filtering of resources.

- Timelapse view of the 3D cluster to show the sequence of resource creation and removal.  The timelapse can be paused and viewed second-by-second along with interacting with the 3D view.

- Schematic views of workloads deployed in the cluster.  Interact with the schematic and view detail resource definitions.  Mouse over items and drill down to view detail resource information.

- View storage defined for the cluster by StorageClass, PV, PVC, CSI, along with node related storage.  

- View network IP addresses and address ranges for services, pods, and nodes. 

- View defined security roles, bindings, and subjects for the cluster or namespaces.

- View Owner References chains for K8s resources defined in the cluster.

- View event message statistics and timeline.

- View container image repositories and associated images.

- Search K8s resources with the ability to filter by namespaces, kinds, labels, resource names, and annotations.
